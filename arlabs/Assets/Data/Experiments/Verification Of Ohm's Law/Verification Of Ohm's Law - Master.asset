  _theory: "<size=120%><b>Theory</b></size>\r\n\r\nOhm\u2019s Law states that the
    current (<b>I</b>) flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the
    potential difference (<b>V</b>) across its ends, provided that the physical conditions
    (such as temperature and dimensions) remain constant. This relationship is given
    by:\r\n\r\n<indent=20%><size=110%><b>V = I \xD7 R</b></size></indent>\r\n\r\nwhere
    <b>R</b> is the resistance of the conductor.\r\n\r\n<size=110%><b>Key Points:</b></size>\r\n-
    <b>Direct Proportionality:</b> Increasing the voltage results in a proportional
    increase in current if the resistance remains unchanged.\r\n- <b>Graphical Representation:</b>
    When plotting voltage (<b>V</b>) versus current (<b>I</b>), the resulting straight
    line passes through the origin. The slope of this line (<b>V/I</b>) is equal
    to the resistance <b>R</b>.\r\n- <b>Dependence on Material and Geometry:</b>
    The resistance depends on factors like the material's resistivity, the length
    of the conductor, its cross-sectional area, and temperature.\r\n- <b>Experimental
    Verification:</b> In the experiment, several sets of voltage and current measurements
    are recorded. The nearly constant ratio of <b>V/I</b> across these sets confirms
    the validity of Ohm\u2019s Law.\r\n\r\nThis theory forms the basis for verifying
    the linear relationship between <b>V</b> and <b>I</b> in the experiment and for
    determining the resistance of the conductor.\r\n"
  _procedure: '<size=120%><b>Procedure</b></size>



    1. Initially, the key (<b>K</b>)
    is closed, and the rheostat is adjusted to get the minimum reading in the ammeter
    (<b>A</b>) and voltmeter (<b>V</b>).



    2. The current in the circuit is
    increased gradually by moving the sliding terminal of the rheostat. During the
    process, the current flowing in the circuit and the corresponding value of potential
    difference across the resistance wire (<b>R</b>) are recorded.



    3. This
    way, different sets of values of voltage and current are obtained.



    4.
    For each set of values of <b>V</b> and <b>I</b>, the ratio <b>V/I</b> is calculated.



    5.
    When you calculate the ratio <b>V/I</b> for each case, you will notice that it
    is almost the same. So <b>V/I = R</b>, which is a constant.



    6. Plot a
    graph of the current against the potential difference; it will be a straight
    line. This shows that the current is proportional to the potential difference.
