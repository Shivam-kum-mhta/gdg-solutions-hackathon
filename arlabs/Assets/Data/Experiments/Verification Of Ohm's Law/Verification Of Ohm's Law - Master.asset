  _theory: "<size=120%><b>Theory</b></size>\\r\\n\\r\\nOhm\\u2019s Law states that
    the\r\n    current (<b>I</b>) flowing through a conductor is directly proportional
    to the\r\n    potential difference (<b>V</b>) across its ends, provided that
    the physical conditions\r\n    (such as temperature and dimensions) remain constant.
    This relationship is given\r\n    by:\\r\\n\\r\\n<indent=20%><size=110%><b>V
    = I \\xD7 R</b></size></indent>\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere\r\n    <b>R</b> is the resistance
    of the conductor.\\r\\n\\r\\n<size=110%><b>Key Points:</b></size>\\r\\n-\r\n   
    <b>Direct Proportionality:</b> Increasing the voltage results in a proportional\r\n   
    increase in current if the resistance remains unchanged.\\r\\n- <b>Graphical
    Representation:</b>\r\n    When plotting voltage (<b>V</b>) versus current (<b>I</b>),
    the resulting straight\r\n    line passes through the origin. The slope of this
    line (<b>V/I</b>) is equal\r\n    to the resistance <b>R</b>.\\r\\n- <b>Dependence
    on Material and Geometry:</b>\r\n    The resistance depends on factors like the
    material's resistivity, the length\r\n    of the conductor, its cross-sectional
    area, and temperature.\\r\\n- <b>Experimental\r\n    Verification:</b> In the
    experiment, several sets of voltage and current measurements\r\n    are recorded.
    The nearly constant ratio of <b>V/I</b> across these sets confirms\r\n    the
    validity of Ohm\\u2019s Law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis theory forms the basis for verifying\r\n   
    the linear relationship between <b>V</b> and <b>I</b> in the experiment and for\r\n   
    determining the resistance of the conductor.\\r\\n"
  _procedure: "<size=120%><b>Procedure</b></size>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. Initially,
    the key (<b>K</b>)\r\n    is closed, and the rheostat is adjusted to get the
    minimum reading in the ammeter\r\n    (<b>A</b>) and voltmeter (<b>V</b>).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   
    2. The current in the circuit is\r\n    increased gradually by moving the sliding
    terminal of the rheostat. During the\r\n    process, the current flowing in the
    circuit and the corresponding value of potential\r\n    difference across the
    resistance wire (<b>R</b>) are recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    3. This\r\n    way,
    different sets of values of voltage and current are obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   
    4.\r\n    For each set of values of <b>V</b> and <b>I</b>, the ratio <b>V/I</b>
    is calculated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    5.\r\n    When you calculate the ratio <b>V/I</b>
    for each case, you will notice that it\r\n    is almost the same. So <b>V/I =
    R</b>, which is a constant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    6. Plot a\r\n    graph of the
    current against the potential difference; it will be a straight\r\n    line.
    This shows that the current is proportional to the potential difference.\r\n"
