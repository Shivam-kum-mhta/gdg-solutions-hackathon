  _theory: "<size=120%><b>Theory</b></size>\r\n\r\nA simple pendulum consists of
    a small bob suspended from a fixed support by a string of length (<b>L</b>) that
    allows it to oscillate freely. When displaced and released, the pendulum undergoes
    Simple Harmonic Motion (<b>SHM</b>), where the restoring force acting on the
    bob is proportional to its displacement and directed towards the equilibrium
    position.\r\n\r\nThe time period (<b>T</b>) of oscillation for small amplitudes
    is given by:\r\n\r\n<indent=20%><size=110%><b>T = 2\u03C0\u221A(L/g)</b></size></indent>\r\n\r\nwhere: 
    \r\n- <b>T</b> = Time period of one complete oscillation (seconds)  \r\n- <b>L</b>
    = Length of the pendulum (meters)  \r\n- <b>g</b> = Acceleration due to gravity
    (9.8 m/s\xB2)  \r\n"
  _procedure: "<size=120%><b>Procedure</b></size>\r\n\r\n1. Place the clamp stand
    and pendulum on a table. Take care that the bob hangs vertically (about 2 cm
    above the floor) beyond the edge of the table so that it is free to oscillate.\r\n\r\n2.
    Measure the effective length of the simple pendulum as shown in the figure.\r\n\r\n3.
    Displace the bob not more than 15 degrees from the vertical position and then
    gently release it. Make sure that the bob oscillates in a vertical plane about
    its rest and does not:  \r\n   (i) spin about its own axis  \r\n   (ii) move
    up and down while oscillating  \r\n   (iii) revolve in an elliptic path around
    its mean position  \r\n\r\n4. Keep the pendulum oscillating for a few minutes.
    After a few oscillations, start the stopwatch as the thread attached to the bob
    crosses the mean position. Consider it as a zero oscillation.\r\n\r\n5. Keep
    counting the oscillations <b>1,2,3\u2026n</b> every time the bob crosses the
    mean position. Stop the stopwatch at the count of <b>n</b> oscillations. For
    better results, <b>n</b> should be chosen such that the time taken to complete
    <b>n</b> oscillations is 50 s or more. Read the total time taken for <b>n</b>
    oscillations. Repeat the observation a few times by noting down the time for
    the same <b>n</b> number of oscillations. Once noted down, take the mean of the
    readings. Calculate the time for one oscillation, i.e., the time period <b>T
    (= t/n)</b> of the pendulum.\r\n\r\n6. Change the length of the pendulum by about
    10 cm. Repeat step 6 again for finding the time (<b>t</b>) for about 20 oscillations
    or more for the new length and find the mean time period. Take 5 or 6 more observations
    for different lengths of the pendulum and find the mean time period in each case.\r\n\r\n7.
    Report observations in tabular form with proper units and significant figures.\r\n\r\n8.
    Take effective length <b>L</b> along the x-axis and <b>T\xB2</b> (or <b>T</b>)
    along the y-axis, using the observed values from the table. Choose suitable scales
    on these axes to represent <b>L</b> and <b>T\xB2</b> (or <b>T</b>). Plot a graph
    between <b>L</b> and <b>T\xB2</b> as shown in Figure 2 and also between <b>L</b>
    and <b>T</b> as shown in Figure 1.\r\n"
